# Prime-number-generator-and-checker-
📌 Description
> This project is a simple yet efficient tool for generating prime numbers and checking whether a given number is prime. It is built for my AI assessment and demonstrates algorithmic implementation for prime number detection.A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has only two factors: 1 and itself. For example, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, ... are prime numbers. The goal of this project is to develop a Prime Number Generator and Checker, which allows users to:

Generate a list of prime numbers up to a given limit.
Check whether a given number is prime.
This project will be implemented using Python, incorporating efficient algorithms for prime number detection and generation.

🚀 Features
> Generate a list of prime numbers up to a given limit
> Check if a specific number is prime
> Optimized algorithms for efficiency
> User-Friendly – Simple command-line interface for easy interaction

🔍 Usage
> To generate prime numbers up to a certain limit, run the script and enter the desired range.
> To check if a number is prime, input the number when prompted.

🚀 Applications
> Cryptography – Prime numbers are crucial in encryption algorithms like RSA
> AI & Machine Learning – Used in problem-solving & optimization problems
> Mathematical Research – Study of number theory and prime distributions
> Performance Benchmarking – Comparing algorithm efficiencies

📖 Example Usage

Enter the limit to generate prime numbers: 50
Output: [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47]
Enter a number to check: 31
Output: 31 is a prime number.
